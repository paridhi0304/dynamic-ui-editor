How the Editor Works

All customization is handled in the sidebar.

The main area shows a real-time preview of your current configuration, including background, text, images, and product controls.

Product and image gallery customization are modular and easy to extend.

Export your settings as JSON for use in other systems or for handoff.

Customization & UX Decisions

Grouped Sidebar Sections: All controls are logically grouped for clarity and quick access, inspired by design tools like Figma.

Live Visual Feedback: Every control offers immediate feedback in the preview area for a seamless experience.

Gallery Controls: Users can adjust alignment, spacing, and border radius of images, reflecting modern product configurators.

Minimal Dependencies: The editor uses only React and built-in hooks for maximum clarity and ease of assessment.

Figma-Driven Styling: Margins, paddings, button shapes, and control grouping follow the assignment reference for visual consistency.

Export/Import: (Export implemented, import can be added for extensibility.)
